Here's a breakdown of the term:\n\n- **Generative**: This indicates that the model can generate text based on the input it receives. It's a generative model because it can produce new content.\n\n- **Pre-trained**: GPT models are pre-trained on a large corpus of text from the internet. This means they have already learned a lot about language structures, grammar, facts, and some level of reasoning prior to being fine-tuned or used for specific tasks.\n\n- **Transformer**: This refers to the architecture of the model. The transformer architecture, introduced in the paper \"Attention is All You Need\" by Vaswani et al. in 2017, is particularly effective for language understanding and generation tasks. It utilizes mechanisms like self-attention that allows it to weigh the significance of different words in context when generating or interpreting text.\n\nGPT models, such as GPT-3 and its successors, have been widely used for various natural language processing tasks, including text generation, translation, summarization, and more.","model":"gpt-4o","latency_ms":3858}
